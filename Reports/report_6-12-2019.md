#  Report of Friday 06 December 2019

For the moment, we separated ourselves in small different groups working on different parts of the project that we will later assemble.

We have one group working on the map with the player being able to move on the map, talk to people, etc..., one group working on the fights between Pokemon and how they evolve, and a last group working on the Pok√©mon's appearance, names and the scenario of the game (the order of events).


## Pokemon and Scenario Team

We completed the pokedex which now functions smoothly. For next week we want to 'attach' it to the main map / menu. We also finished the introduction making it smooth, once again our goal for next week is to 'attach' it to the rest of the project. We have also implemented pokemons and now need to discuss with the other teams to implement them everywhere. Finally, we have nearly completed the backpack, once again we must communicate with the other teams to make sure everythng is linked and works well. Next week, we will work on the shop, money and pokecenter.

## Map Team

This week, Benjamin worked on talking with PNJ. He managed also to create a table to know at any time on what type of block he is standing on as well as what type of block is blocking him from moving forward (for example if it is water there is a pokemon that can swim). Finally, he created a random number generator so that if the player is on a block of type grass he as a small probability of finding a Pokemon and engaging a fight wit him. 
Arthur: I work on the collision map in order to manage the change of maps. Next week, I will organise the code between the map, the trainer and start linking the different branches.
Amine worked on implementing the chat with the NPC. Now, we would be able to speak with Npcs (displaying of a bubble) and we can't move while this is happening.

## Fight Team

This week, Anya improved the health bar visually. She also improved the shooting of the opponent slightly, adding a probability for when it shoots. She also created the possibility of having "game states" (different screens) and created a start menu for the game which shows before commencing a fight. Next week, she will continue to work on the game states with Antonin to handle when the Pokemon/opponent dies/is caught/etc...

## Pokemon Team

This week, Maxence and Julien worked on the graphical implementation of the Pokedex, and worked with Clement to finish the design and code of the menu and the introduction of the game, using the script they had prepared. Clement went forward with the creation of a backpack containing the different elements one wants to keep throughout the game. Next week, they are going to finalise the different aspects of this task and start helping the Map Team.
