#  Report of Friday 06 December 2019

For the moment, we separated ourselves in small different groups working on different parts of the project that we will later assemble.

We have one group working on the map with the player being able to move on the map, talk to people, etc..., one group working on the fights between Pokemon and how they evolve, and a last group working on the Pok√©mon's appearance, names and the scenario of the game (the order of events).

Arthur: I implemented a tree generator function to fill up the borders of the map with trees. I finished the speaking function of the NPC.
