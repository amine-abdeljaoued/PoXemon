#  Report of Friday 06 December 2019

For the moment, we separated ourselves in small different groups working on different parts of the project that we will later assemble.

We have one group working on the map with the player being able to move on the map, talk to people, etc..., one group working on the fights between Pokemon and how they evolve, and a last group working on the Pokémon's appearance, names and the scenario of the game (the order of events).


## Pokemon and Scenario Team

We have finished the backpack and have added sell/delete function to it. We have finished the intro in particular with the pokemon choosing. We have also worked with Ben to link the intro to the game so that now we have an intro each time we start the game. We have also started working with the fight team to create super attacks and have created so far the first super water attack animation which we now need to implement. For next week we will continue creating super attacks animations and try to put them in the game. We will also work on linking the pokedex and the backpack to the game. We will work alongside the map team to create shops and think about creating a pokeBag.

## Map Team

Arthur: I implemented a tree generator function to fill up the borders of the map with trees. I finished the speaking function of the NPC.
This week, Benjamin linked the intro with the map to start linking the project together. He also started to link the map with the backpack but it is not fully working yet as some work is needed in backpack. He also fixed the issue with the tileset 2 and rearranged the constant to be able to create bigger maps easily in future. Next week, he will continue linking different parts of the project together.

## Fight Team



Last week, François worked on the trajectory of the pokeballs and made them rotate. This week, François worked on the probabilities of catching the pokemons in function of their health and on creating a new game state. This week, he has worked on the probabilties of catching the pokemon in function of their life level. He has started to help the map team with graphics and animation. He is going to try to implement a fishing mode in which some pokemons can be catch by fishing.
