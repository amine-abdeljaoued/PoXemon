#  Report of Friday 06 December 2019

For the moment, we separated ourselves in small different groups working on different parts of the project that we will later assemble.

We have one group working on the map with the player being able to move on the map, talk to people, etc..., one group working on the fights between Pokemon and how they evolve, and a last group working on the Pokémon's appearance, names and the scenario of the game (the order of events).


## Pokemon and Scenario Team


## Map Team

Arthur: I implemented a tree generator function to fill up the borders of the map with trees. I finished the speaking function of the NPC.
## Fight Team



Last week, François worked on the trajectory of the pokeballs and made them rotate. This week, François worked on the probabilities of catching the pokemons in function of their health and on creating a new game state. Next week, he will probably work on small graphic animations and help the map team.
