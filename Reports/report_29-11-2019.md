#  Report of Friday 22 November 2019

For the moment, we separated ourselves in small different groups working on different parts of the project that we will later assemble.

We have one group working on the map with the player being able to move on the map, talk to people, etc..., one group working on the fights between Pokemon and how they evolve, and a last group working on the Pok√©mon's appearance, names and the scenario of the game (the order of events).


## Pokemon and Scenario Team

## Map Team

Amine implemented the Npc (non-player character) class. He also did a map class, handling the drawing of the trainer, background and Npcs in the right order and allowing us to switch maps with all their Npcs easily.

## Fight Team
