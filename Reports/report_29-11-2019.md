#  Report of Friday 29 November 2019

For the moment, we separated ourselves in small different groups working on different parts of the project that we will later assemble.

We have one group working on the map with the player being able to move on the map, talk to people, etc..., one group working on the fights between Pokemon and how they evolve, and a last group working on the Pok√©mon's appearance, names and the scenario of the game (the order of events).


## Pokemon and Scenario Team

Maxence and Julien finished the automatic face cropper and implemented an editor to make it work with pokemons. Since the visual result was rather poor, the project was scrapped and pokemons will now be designed with alex onger pokemon fusion website. Started creating new pokemons and used/edited Francois random name generator program to find names for these new pokemons. Brainstormed with the fights team on how to implement the pokemons. Julien, Maxence and Clement also started using SFML to create a menu in the pokemon game to access different things such as the Backpack, Pokedex ... Clement started to find some ways to pause the game by modifying the game loop so as to start implementing the menu in the main game. The goal for next week is to continue working on the menu, creating new pokemons with all attributes and maybe start giving a hand to the map team to manually create maps.

## Map Team
Amine implemented the Npc (non-player character) class. He also did a map class, handling the drawing of the trainer, background and Npcs in the right order and allowing us to switch maps with all their Npcs easily. He started and will be working next week on displaying text when approaching the Npcs (and stop the movement of the player). But in order to do that he needs to work on the resizing of the window so that the bubble of text will always have the appropriate size.

This week, Benjamin updated some classes in order to be able to go from on map to another (so that we don't have to load one big map and instead several small map that we link together). He also updated the collision table in order to know what is the type of the case the player is on (for example to know if he is on tall grass he can find pokemon with a probability 1/10). Next week, he will work more on the link between maps to make a transition between them and update the players position on the new map as well as update the collision map with the new maps.

Arthur did a smooth black transition while going from a map to another. He also updated the player movement function in order to have a smooth and bloc to bloc movements. Next week he will work on the finding of pokemons in the grass and iteraction with the PNGs.


## Fight Team
The fight team started working on the opponent this week.

Anya finished the health bar class, which shows the level of health of a pokemon during a fight and changes size and color as the pokemon loses health. She sorted the code into further classes, creating the Artillery class so that the handling of the bullets is no longer controlled in the Pokemon class. She started working on the Opponent's shooting, who can now shoot pseudorandomly. Next week, she will improve the shooting of the opponent, deciding where the bullets will fly, adding slight error in how it shoots, etc... (make it more human). 

This week, Francois has worked on the Backpack and Pokeball classes. We now have to click during the fight on three different pokeball icons to launch the pokeballs. He created subclasses for different types of pokeballs corresponding to different probabilities of catching the pokemons. Next week, he will improve the physics behind the trajectories of the pokeballs and make them roatate and maybe do the animation of the capture of a pokemon.
