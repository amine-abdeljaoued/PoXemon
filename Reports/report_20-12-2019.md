#  Report of Friday 20 December 2019

For the moment, we separated ourselves in small different groups working on different parts of the project that we will later assemble.

We have one group working on the map with the player being able to move on the map, talk to people, etc..., one group working on the fights between Pokemon and how they evolve, and a last group working on the Pokémon's appearance, names and the scenario of the game (the order of events).


## Pokemon and Scenario Team

We have worked on two main tasks this week: on the one hand, have continued working on the maps, completing a "sports" map, in order to continue making the map-campus-world bigger and bigger. On the other hand, we have continued working on superattacks, completing a rock superattack, which can help the fight team. Our plan for next week is to continue working with the team map to implement new maps and eventually create another one and to work on superattacks for the fights. Moreover, we will try and debug the pokebag and implement the pokedex in the game. Finally, we will be ready to help in the process of building and assembling the whole game together.

## Map Team

Arthur: I implemented a function to fish in the lac. I started working on the interior of the Poke Shop and going in and out. I rearranged the drawing function of the Trainer to clear the main. I created a shop and the graphic interface. Next week, I will start linking the map with the fights and work on the spawning places of the trainer.

Benjamin: I implemented a function to save the game and save your progression in the game by writing a textfile and updating it through the game. I also added a new map and added a portal from the first map. I also fixed bugs on the intro and fixed the portal bugs to go back and forth from maps.

Amine: I fixed our drawing functions to always draw the npcs, text, map and trainer in the right order depending on their positions to have coherent graphics. I worked with Arthur on the interior of the Pokeshop. I implemented there a Npc seller with whom you can talk and wrote the collision map. I also put a Npc in the underground at the end of the maze.
Next week, I will implement a class for sign that display text and I will work on putting the whole game together. I might try to implement a map or develop the actual one as well.

François: I started to help the map team since this week. First of all I created a new map of the underground with a maze, which Benjamin added on github. I have started to work on a plant growing mode where we could plant some berries on the map but I encountered some technical problems on X-code and I had a debug during much time. Next week, I will continue to implement new maps and I will probably continue to work on the plant growing mode.

## Fight Team

Anya: I implemented the first of the special attacks: a new bullet with animation that inflicts more harm. I started the special attacks bar to display this and countdowns/timers related to the special attacks (not complete yet). I also restructed the code, moving code from main to a new class 'Fight' so that our section can be linked to the rest of the game. Next week I will work on the special attacks bar, fixing bugs and improving the start menu.

Antonin: I continued working on states when pokemons die. These states are different based on several elements: the game mode (against a trainer or a wild pokemon), the pokemons that we still have in our backpack, as well as the opponent trainer's backpack. Depending on these elements, at the end of a fight, we either have a menu with buttons allowing us to run (only in 'wild' mode) or choose another pokemon, or a message saying that we won or lost the game.
I also improved the bot (opponent), by making it jump when a bullet approaches. It still needs some improvement, to make it easier or harder to beat depending on its level.
Next week, I will improve my existing code and work on recurring bugs, work on catching pokemons with the pokeball, and discuss with other people to link the fights with the rest of the game.
