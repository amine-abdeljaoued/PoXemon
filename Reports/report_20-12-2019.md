#  Report of Friday 20 December 2019

For the moment, we separated ourselves in small different groups working on different parts of the project that we will later assemble.

We have one group working on the map with the player being able to move on the map, talk to people, etc..., one group working on the fights between Pokemon and how they evolve, and a last group working on the Pok√©mon's appearance, names and the scenario of the game (the order of events).


## Pokemon and Scenario Team

We have continued working on the maps, finishing a "sport" map. We have continued working on superattacks, completing a rock superattack. For next week we will try to continue working with the team map to implement the new maps and maybe create another one and to work on superattacks for the fights. We will try and debug the pokebag and implement the pokedex in the game.



## Map Team

Arthur: I implemented a function to fish in the lac. I started working on the interior of the Poke Shop and going in and out. I rearranged also the drawing function of the Trainer to clear the main. Next week, I will start linking the map with the fights.
