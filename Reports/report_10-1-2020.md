#  Report of Friday 10th January 2020

For the moment, we separated ourselves in small different groups working on different parts of the project that we will later assemble.

We have one group working on the map with the player being able to move on the map, talk to people, etc..., one group working on the fights between Pokemon and how they evolve, and a last group working on the Pok√©mon's appearance, names and the scenario of the game (the order of events).


## Pokemon and Scenario Team


## Map Team

Benjamin: I finished the final maps and ordered the previous maps to create a real progression and a scenario to the game. I also added npcs to make the game harder and not to be able to move from one map to another until you finished the mission. We now have a real progression to the game as well as an end so that it is possible to finish the game by beating the final boss.
I also added function toi correct bugs and make the game smoother. We now just need to fixed minor bugs between the links between the map and the fights before Sunday and the game will be finished.

Francois:This week I worked on a new map of the interior of a building that Arthur pushed for me. I also worked on a light effect for the underground map which shades the map at given distance of the player creating a spot of light on the player. 

Arthur: I created a dying state where we are teleported back to the pokeCenter if all of our pokemon are dead after a combat. I implemented Francois' map and added Npcs and easter eggs in it. I fix some minors bugs in the map.
