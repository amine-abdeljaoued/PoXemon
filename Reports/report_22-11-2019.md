#  Report of Friday 22 November 2019

For the moment, we separated ourselves in small different groups working on different parts of the project that we will later assemble.

We have one group working on the map with the player being able to move on the map, talk to people, etc..., one group working on the fights between Pokemon and how they evolve, and a last group working on the Pokémon's appearance, names and the scenario of the game (the order of events).


## Pokemon and Scenario Team
This week Julien, Clement and Maxence have started to brainstorm ideas on the script and on the general storyline of the game. 
Julien and Maxence have also started to learn how to used OpenCV in order to create an automatic Pokemon face photoshop. The idea is for the moment to have a unique Pokemon per player that would be created from his face at the beginning of the game. 
Clément and Julien also started to work on the implementation of the dialogues into the games. To this end, all the group started learning how to use sfml. Moreover, the group has started creating a menu which will include a « pokedex », « backpack » and parameters. 
Clement focused in particular on the design of the different characters, while Julien and Maxence started designing the implementation of dialogues inside the game. 
Next week, we will try to get a first version of a menu and work on the face automatic photoshop, and keep focusing on the OpenCV program and start implementing the menu and introduction on SFML.


## Map Team
Benjamin has created the first map from scratch by using a function to load sprites and created a first map that looks like the campus lake. He made the player move but then Amine and Arthur worked on it to make the movement smoother using sprites and faster (Arthur managed to make the player run faster by holding shift). Benjamin then created a collision file which is a table that indicates where the player can or cant go. This can be easily improved in order to know what is blocking the player (for example if it is water he will be able to use a Pokemon to go on water). Next week he will work on trying to link to maps and to go inside buildings and houses.
This week, Amine designed and implemented the trainer (main character) class, handling its displacement on the map. He also did a class to represent the map. Then, he tried to organize the code, creating a constant file and implementing a Makefile. Next week, he will work again on the character displacement and he will try to implement our first non-player character on the map that would have interactions with our character.

## Fight Team
This week the fight team starting creating the basics of the fights in the game.  
Anya created a basic sprite who can jump, move and shoot and started working on the live health bar. Next week, Anya will finish the health bar and work on the visuals, allowing the game to follow the sprite as it moves left and right.
Antonin improved the shooting, with limited number of bullets and a waiting period for bullets to regenerate.  Now our pokemon is able to shoot bullets in the direction of the mouse when we click, and it has a limited number of bullets, that regenerates with time. He also organized the files and split the code. He will finish working on the bullets next week.
François started working on implementing poke balls. He will continue on it next week.
Jiahe is working on the opponent Pokemon during the fights, trying to react to the players attack and initiate attacks. Jiahe will continue working on the opponents in the fight.
