#  Report of Friday 3rd January 2020

For the moment, we separated ourselves in small different groups working on different parts of the project that we will later assemble.

We have one group working on the map with the player being able to move on the map, talk to people, etc..., one group working on the fights between Pokemon and how they evolve, and a last group working on the Pokémon's appearance, names and the scenario of the game (the order of events).


## Pokemon and Scenario Team



## Map Team
Arthur: This holiday I worked on linking map togethers by creating different spawning locations for each of them and number associated to them. I also created the interior of the pokeCenter. I implemented a way to have a scenario and have specific dialogue with the NPCs only after certain event occur. I also worked on the visual aspect of entering buildings by opening the door and create the illusion of entering the building. Next week I will implement the scenario.


François: I worked at the beginning of the holidays on the implementation of a new map representing the demi-lunes. I will continue to implement new maps during the next week.

## Fight Team

Benjamin: This holidays, I continued working on the maps by adding new maps and linking them together. Next week I will link them map by map to create a sort of progression. I also fixed minor bugs to make the game smoother.

Anya: This holiday I worked on various aspects of the fights. I improved the start menu, and added a countdown for when you press start, and added a how to play menu. I fixed the special attacks bar, which now has an increasing and decreasing size bar that shows how much time you have left of your special attack and how long until it is available again and changes color depending on which state you are in. It also has a picture of the special attack which goes black and white when the attack is no longer available. I also fixed a major bug we had been having for the last month (a segmentation fault bug). Next week we will work on completing the fights and linking it to the rest of the game. 

## Pokemon Team

We continued contributing to the creation of maps, designing a map of the Bachelor buildings.
