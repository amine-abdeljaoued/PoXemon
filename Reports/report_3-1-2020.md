#  Report of Friday 3rd January 2020

For the moment, we separated ourselves in small different groups working on different parts of the project that we will later assemble.

We have one group working on the map with the player being able to move on the map, talk to people, etc..., one group working on the fights between Pokemon and how they evolve, and a last group working on the Pokémon's appearance, names and the scenario of the game (the order of events).


## Pokemon and Scenario Team



## Map Team



François: I worked at the beginning of the holidays on the implementation of a new map representing the demi-lunes. I will continue to implement new maps during the next week.

## Fight Team

Benjamin: This holidays, I continued working on the maps by adding new maps and linking them together. Next week I will link them map by map to create a sort of progression. I also fixed minor bugs to make the game smoother.

## Pokemon Team
