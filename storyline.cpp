/* Initial screen: beginning of the game; we start as in the real Pokemon game:

Hi! Sorry to keep you waiting!
Welcome to the world of [Pokemon]
My name is [Didy]
But everyone calls me [Pokemon Professor]"
This is what we call [Pokemon]
The world is widely inhabited by creatures called [Pokemon]
We humas live alongside Pokemon, at times as friendly playmates, and at
times as cooperative workmates,
And sometimes, we band together and battle others like us.
But despite our closeness, we don't know everything about [Pokemon].
In fact, there are many, many secrets surrounding [Pokemon].
To unravel [Pokemon] mysteries, I've been undertaking research.
That's what I do. And you are?
Are you a boy? Or are you a girl?
