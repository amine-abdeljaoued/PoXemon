# Project Report for PoXemon

  In this project, we split into three different groups working on specific aspects of the game which we later put together.

  The first one group (Benjamin, Amine and Arthur) worked on the map and all the actions linked to it; movement, NPC interaction, creating a real game progression, etc... The second group (Anya, Antonin and Jiahe) worked on the fights between PoXemons and how to catch them. Finally, the third group (Maxence, Julien, Clement and Francois) worked  on the other aspects on the game; creating the PoXemon's appearance,the backpack, the Pokedex, the intro, and also helped the other teams in their respective parts. Even though the project was split into three parts, the communication and collaboration between groups thrived throughout the duration of the project, making it a both pleasant and constructive project. 
  
  All in all, we had a lot of fun working on this remake of one of our favourite childhood games and we learned a lot about the never ending potential of C++.
