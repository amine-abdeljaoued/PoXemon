### Project Report

For the project, we separated ourselves at the beginning into small different groups working on different parts of the project that we later assembled.

We thus had one group working on the map with the player being able to move on the map, talk to people, creating a real game progression, etc... (Benjamin, Amine and Arthur), one group working on the fights between PoXemons and how they evolve (Anya, Antonin and Jiahe), and a last group working on the rest: PoXemon's appearance, names and small things like the backpack and Pokedex, and also helping the other teams to create maps for example (Maxence, Julien, Clement and Francois).]
