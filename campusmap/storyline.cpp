/* Initial screen: beginning of the game; we start as in the real Pokemon game:

Hi! Sorry to keep you waiting!
Welcome to the world of Pokemen!
My name is Didy.
But everyone calls me Pokemen Professor."
This is what we call Pokeman.
The campus is widely inhabited by creatures known as Pokemen.
We humans live alongside Pokemon, at times as friendly playmates, and at
times as cooperative workmates.
And sometimes, we band together and battle others like us.
But despite our closeness, we don't know everything about Pokemen.
In fact, there are many, many secrets surrounding Pokemen.
To unravel Pokemen mysteries, I've been undertaking research.
That's what I do.

And you are?

*CHOICE* (name)

Are you a boy? Are you a girl? Or are you anything else?

*CHOICE* (gender)

Tell me [name], do you like Pokemen?

*CHOICE* (either game either main menu)

- That’s a shame. Have a nice journey home.

[You attempt to walk back to your house.
On the way you receive a Moodle notification from the Physics professor.
You have a midterm tomorrow, but you do not understand physics at all. You get
smashed by a 0.5/20.]

- In this world, there is one, big, single threat: in one week from now, you
will have to face an Engineering final exam during the Coupe de l'X.
For this, you have to band with Pokemen who will help you defeat the Grand
Master Golsy.
You have to accept your Pokemen with love and respect. For that, I'll have you
choose one of my three precious Pokemen.

*CHOICE* (pokeman, either David, either Maxence, either Benjamin)

- Ah, so you want to choose the physics type Pokeman. That’s wonderful!
- Ah, so you want to choose the economics type Pokeman. That’s wonderful!
- Ah, so you want to choose the computer science type Pokeman. That’s wonderful!

That reminds me, would you like to fight my daughter May? She started out just
like you!

Oh, hi, [name]! It's me, May!
Oh, I see, my dad gave you a Pokeman as a gift. Since we're here, let's have a
quick battle! I'll give you a taste of what being a Scientist is like.

*BATTLE* (between [Pokeman] and Rodrigo)

Congratulations! Now you look definitely ready to be a proper Scientist. And
remember, in the game of Pokemen, either you pass the final, either you die. And
be aware of the wild Rodrigos!
