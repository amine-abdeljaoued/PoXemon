# PoXemon
Repository for our CSE201 Project in C++

It is a Pokemon based-game.
For this project, we're using the SFML library.

We splitted the work into 3 main teams.
The first one is working on the map and the character.
The second on Pokemons, the main menu and in-game features.
And the third one on fights to which we'd like to add more dynamism.
