# Pokemon
Repository for our CSE201 Project in C++

It is a Pokemon based-game.
For this project, we're using the SFML library.

We splitted the work into 3 main teams.
The first one is working on the map and the character.
The second on Pokemons
And the third one on fights to which we'd like to add more dynamism.
