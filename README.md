# Pokemon
Repository for our CSE201 Project in C++

This is a program that generates pokemon-like names. 
The principe of the program is to compute conditionnal probabilities of appearances of letters in pokemon names.
Out of a freqtable, we just have to generate some randoms numbers and then construct the generated name.
