FIGHTS

//basic description---------------------------------------------------------------

When we encounter a pokemon in the map, we can choose to fight it
When we fight against a pokemon:
- we gain some xp, by causing damage to the other pokemon. ?
- we can try to catch it (the probability of catching it will depend on 
the amount of life it still has, and maybe other parameters like its scarcity )

First, when we decide to fight, a window appears and we can choose our pokemon
among those that are available in our 'backpack'.

Then the fight begins.
The idea is to create a 2d shooter game.

our pokemon can move right and left, jump, shoot 'bullets', use 'special attacks'

if we catch a pokemon or if we kill it, the fight ends.
